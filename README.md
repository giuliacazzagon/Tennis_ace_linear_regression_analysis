# Tennis Ace Linear Regression analysis

The scope of the project is to perform a Liner Regression analysis on tennis statistics to understand what is the best way to predict wins.

Provided in `tennis_stats.csv` is data from the menâ€™s professional tennis league, which is called the [TP (Association of Tennis Professionals)](https://www.atptour.com/en/). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of `2009` to `2017` are provided in the file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.

### Project Structure

The project is divided in the following sections:
- **Import Python modules**: import modules that will be necessary for the project
- **Loading the Data**: load data into dataframes and have a glance at the data
- **Cleaning the Data**: check for null values, duplicates, data types and change specific names if necessary
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: check for relationship between features and specific outcomes
- **Linear Regression with one feature**: find single best feature to predict speficic outcome
- **Linear Regression with multiple feature:** find multiple best features to predict specific outcome
- **Conclusions**: summarize findings
